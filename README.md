# PortFolio_Project
This portfolio highlights my work in machine learning and AI, including prototypes for computer vision and temperature-monitoring software. Pre-trained models from Kaggle, Hugging Face and other repository. I primarily use Python, R, Power BI, and SQL for data analysis, with cloud services for larger tasks, showcasing my skills and work ethic.
